## [A] Power system identification
When supplying power to the fuse, it indicates the position of the ignition key. The line code "30" is a live line, which is generally provided by the front compartment electrical box or the instrument panel electrical box. For details, see the power circuit diagram. IG1, IG3 and IG4 are the live wires when the start switch is in the ON or START position. See the power circuit diagram for details;

## [B] Fuse
Indicate the name and current magnitude of the fuse;
* The fuses of front compartment distribution box are numbered as F1/X according to the corresponding position, F means the fuse code, 1 means the installation position is in front compartment distribution box, X means the serial number, such as F1/03: Fuse 3 installed in front compartment distribution box.
* The fuses of instrument distribution box are numbered as F2/X according to the corresponding position, F means the fuse code, 2 means the installation position in instrument distribution box, X means the serial number, such as F2/03: Fuse 3 installed in instrument distribution box.
 
> ## Caution
> 
> * If fuses are burned, eliminate the fault before replacing them with new ones;
> * Use fuses specified by the manufacturer. Never use any fuse that exceeds the manufacturer's specified current rating;
> * Never insert fuses partially. Insert them into the holder in place.

## [C] Wire color and wire diameter
*  Wire color: indicates the color of the wire, and the color is represented by the letter code; The wire is divided into single-color and multi-color wire, as shown in the figure below.
