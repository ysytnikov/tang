# Circuit Testing

## Measuring voltage
* For the red probe of multimeter or voltmeter, select the voltage/ohm measurement socket; for the black probe, select the loop socket;
* Set the functional selection switch of multimeter or volt meter to DC voltage range;
* Connect the test probe (the polarity of the test probe can be exchanged with each other);
* Read the voltage value on the multimeter or voltmeter display

## Measuring current
* For the red probe of multimeter or ammeter, select the current measurement socket; for the black probe, select the loop socket;
* Set the function selector switch of multimeter or ampere meter to the current measuring position;
* Connect the multimeter or ampere meter in series in the circuit to be measured (the red positive test probe is connected to the high side of the circuit, and the black negative probe is connected to the low potential side);
* Read the current value in the multimeter.

## Measuring resistance
* For the red probe of multimeter or ohmmeter, select the current /ohm measurement socket; for the black probe, select the loop socket
* Set the function selection switch of multimeter or ohmmeter to ohm gear;
* Connect the multimeter or ohmmeter probe with the resistor or coil to measure its resistance value (make sure the resistor or coil is not charged).

## Measuring diode
* For the red probe of multimeter or ohmmeter, select the voltage measurement socket; for the black probe, select the loop socket;
* Set the multimeter or ohmmeter function selector switch to the diode test block;
* Detect the status of the paths on both sides of the diode. If the diode is on in one direction and is disconnected after switching the test probe, the diode is in good condition;
* If the diode is open in both directions, the diode is broken down. Both directions are not working, indicating that the diode is open-circuited.

## Circuit troubleshooting method
*  Use the test light to find the faults
    * At connector A, a loop is established with the test light and the battery. If the test light is on, it indicates that there is no fault at connector A;
    * At connector B, a loop is established with the test light and the battery. Turn on the circuit switch as shown in the figure. The test light turning on indicates that there is no fault at connector A and the switch;
    * At connector C, use a test light to establish a primary loop with the battery. Turn on the circuit switch as shown in the figure. The test light and the electric appliance working indicates that there is no fault at connector C and the electric appliance;
    * Check the circuit grounding.

* Identify faults with a multimeter
    * Set the multimeter function selector switch to ON/OFF test position;
    * The multimeter black probe is grounded;
    * Set the multimeter red probe at each connection in the circuit to measure voltage in the same way as using the fault lamp.
    * Determine the fault point if the multimeter displays voltage.
